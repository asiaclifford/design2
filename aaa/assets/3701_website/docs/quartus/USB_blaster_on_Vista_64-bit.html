	USB Blaster on 64-bit Vista for Altera's Quartus
</font></center>
<br>

<LI> If you can not program your boards using the USB 
	Blaster, then you will need to configure Vista 
	64-bit to accept unsigned drivers as follows:
<ul>
<LI> Select "Start | Programs | Acessories | " then 
	Right mouse on "Command Prompt" and select 
	"Run as administrator"
<LI> Select "Continue"
<LI> Type: 
	<B>bcdedit /set testsigning on</B>
<LI> Type: 
	<B>bcdedit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS</B>
<LI> Reboot your computer.
</ul>

<LI> Unfortunately, the four corners of your computer will 
	now display <B>Test Mode</B> and the Windows version 	
	will appear in the top center of your display, e.g., 
	<B>Microsoft (R) Windows (R) (Build 6002: Service Pack 2)</B>.
</ul>
