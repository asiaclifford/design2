<h2>PIN IDENTIFICATION</h2>
<p>
<h3>General:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Missing pins have no pin number.
<li>Unconnected pins and test pins that should be left floating have no
   identification.
<li>Clock signals are identified by CLK for positive-edge triggering or /CLK
   for negative-edge triggering.
<li>Reset (clear) inputs are identified by RST.
<li>Set inputs are identified by SET.
<li>For 3-state devices, output enables are indicated by OE.
<li>When a pin has two modes, or selects between two operations, then the
   two may be separated by a slash.  An inversion slash may still be present
   as in SH//LD for shift or load select.
<li>Pins that have more than one function (selected by programming or the state
   of another pin) are indicated by both functions separated by a space.
</ul><p>
<h3>Power supply:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The main power supply is indicated by VCC.
<li>System ground is indicated by GND.
<li>A secondary positive power supply may be indicated by VDD.
<li>A negative power supply is indicated by VEE.
<li>Programming power supply (usually higher than VCC) is indicated by VPP.
</ul><p>
<h3>Gates, line drivers etc.:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inputs are identified by letters starting from A.
<li>Outputs are indicated by Y.
</ul><p>
<h3>Flip-flops:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inputs are identified by J and K, or D.
<li>Outputs are indicated by Q.
</ul><p>
<h3>Counters:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Load inputs are indicated by P followed by the counter stage number.
<li>Outputs are indicated by Q followed by the counter stage number.
   Thus (assuming a binary counter) Q0 is the /2 output, Q1 the /4 output.
</ul><p>
<h3>Shift registers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Parallel inputs or bidirectional parallel I/O pins are identified by P
   followed by the shifter stage number. The leftmost stage in a shift
   register is number 0.
<li>Serial inputs are identified by letters starting from D (for right shift)
   or from L (for left shift).  If more than one of either is available,
   the letter is followed by the shifter stage number it feeds.
<li>Serial outputs are identified by Q, which may be followed by the shifter
   stage number if more than one serial output exists.
<li>Parallel outputs are identified by Q (only if no serial outputs exist),
   Y (3-state outputs or output latch) followed by the shifter stage number.
<li>Unidirectional shift registers shift towards higher stage numbers.
<li>Bidirectional shift registers have separate shift-left and shift-right
   serial inputs.
<li>Parallel-in parallel-out shift registers are called univeral.
</ul><p>
<h3>Multiplexers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inputs are identified by A followed by a number.
<li>Outputs are indicated by Y.
<li>Select inputs are identified by S followed by a number starting at 0,
   unless there is only one select input in which case only S is specified.
   When the S inputs are taken as a binary number, the value indicates
   which input is selected.
</ul><p>
<h3>Demultiplexers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inputs are indicated by A, preceded by a section number if more than one.
<li>Outputs are identified by Y followed by a number.  When there is more than
   one multiplexer section, inputs are prefixed by a number indicating to
   which section they belong.
<li>Select inputs are identified by S followed by a number starting at 0,
   unless there is only one select input in which only S is specified.
   When the S inputs are taken as a binary number, the value indicates
   which output is selected.  For noninverting demultiplexers unselected
   outputs are 0, for inverting demultiplexers they are 1.
</ul><p>
<h3>Analog multiplexers/demultiplexers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analog switches generally are bidirectional, and inputs and outputs can
   therefore be reversed.
   One side of the switch is indicated by X (optionally followed by a number),
   the other side is indicated by Y.
<li>Select inputs are identified by S followed by a number starting at 0,
   unless there is only one select input in which only S is specified.
   When the S inputs are taken as a binary number, the value indicates
   which switch is selected.
</ul><p>
<h3>Memories:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Address inputs are indicated by A followed by the bit number, starting
   from 0.  Multiport memories use RA or WA for separate read and write
   addresses, or A prefixed by the port number followed by the bit number.
<li>Data inputs or data I/O are indicated by D followed by a number starting
   from 0.
<li>Data outputs are indicated by Q followed by a number.
</ul><p>
<h3>Oscillators:</h3>
<ul>
<li>One-inverter oscillators are indicated by X0 and X1 pins, where X0 is
   the inverters' output and X1 is the input.  If I happen not to know which
   is which, the pins are indicated by X1 and X2.  A crystal oscillator
   usually requires a crystal parallel to a 10M resistor, with two small
   capacitors to ground; but sometimes only a crystal is needed -- most
   often when a 32kHz watch crystal can be used.
<li>Two-inverter oscillators are indicated by X1 (input), X0 (middle node)
   and X2 (output).  A crystal oscillator can then be made using X0 and X1.
</ul><p>
<h3>Sections:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When a device has several (largely) independent sections, I/O pins
   are prefixed by the section number, starting from 1, as in 1J or /1Q.
<li>Multi-bit functions, such as counters or 3-state buffers have I/O pins
   suffixed by the bit number, usually starting from 0 (except sometimes
   for counters which may have some outputs missing).
<li>The section/bit numbering is used in a different way for (de)multiplexers.

<h2>TRUTH TABLES</h2>
<p>
For inputs, the following notations are used:
<pre>
   0  : logic low level
   1  : logic high level
   X  : don't care, either 0 or 1
   /  : rising or positive-edge clock input
   \  : falling or negative-edge clock input
   !/ : not a rising edge, either 0, 1 or \
   !\ : not a falling edge, either 0, 1 or /
   .  : 'continued', used in compressing the table
</pre>
<p>
For outputs, the following notations are used:
<pre>
   0 : logic low level
   1 : logic high level
   Z : high impedance, either 3-state or open-collector not driving output
   - : no change (latched in closed state, or register value not changed)
   ? : undefined (although some manufacturers may define a behaviour)
   . : 'continued', used in compressing the table
</pre>
