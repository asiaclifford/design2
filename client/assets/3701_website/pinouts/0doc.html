<title>The Giant Internet IC Master</title>
</head><body><h1>General information, links and copyright statement.</h1>
<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<p>
The Giant Internet IC Master was created by Frank after such a
thing was discussed on sci.electronics.
The name is due to (<a href="mailto:rstevew@delete.this.armory.com">Steve Walz</a>),
and any suggestions on changing it will be forwarded to /dev/null.
<p>
Timing information for ICs is not available, and only TTL, 4000-series
CMOS, some microprocessor (support) and a few analog chips are included.
<p>
A text-based version that you can download into your (portable) computer
is available on Steve's FTP site
(<a class=code href="ftp://ftp.armory.com/pub/user/rstevew">
ftp://ftp.armory.com/pub/user/rstevew</a>).
<p>
To minimize the amount of information needed per IC, a structured format
is used in the descriptions, and only features that differ from the
assumptions below are indicated.  Truth tables are not yet available for
all ICs, because creating them takes a long time or information may not
be available.
<p>
Anyone wanting to add this information should feel free to do so, but
please to not post changed versions.  Instead, mail additions to
<a class=code href="mailto:giicm@kingswood.consulting.co.uk">giicm@kingswood.consulting.co.uk</a>
taking care to change the first dot into a dash.
<p>
Frank
